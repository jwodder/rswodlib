`rswodlib` is a personal collection of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
functions & functionalities that, though useful and often reused, aren't quite
worthy of published packages of their own.  It is not meant to be installed;
instead, if you see anything you like in it, you are encouraged to copy &
paste, subject to the MIT license.

The project is laid out as a [workspace][] in which the root package contains
only code with no (non-test) dependencies beyond `std` (and [`automod`][], for
convenience) while the other packages (all located in `crates/`) require one or
more third-party dependencies each.
